## Penn Apps XXIII

This is our submission for `Penn Apps XXIII`.

We've created a proof-of-concept for detecting diseases using images of plant leaves. We use a neural net trained based on ResNet18 for classification. This ties to a Flask backend, which is called using a Raspberry Pi that can take pictures of leaves. The final result can be read on an OLED screen attached to the Raspberry Pi.
